## Project Overview
This project aimed to enhance the marketing strategy of **_Dr. Laura Ferrer and Associates_**, a private therapy firm offering mental health services. The firm faced challenges such as **_limited online presence_**, with inconsistent social media activity reducing its visibility, **_competitive pressure_** from hospitals, university counseling centers, and other private practices leveraging digital platforms more effectively, and **_high pricing_**, which limited access to broader market segments like students or lower-income groups. The goal was to improve **_client acquisition_**, increase **_engagement_**, and enhance the firm’s **_digital presence_** to compete effectively in a highly competitive local environment. These challenges presented a unique opportunity to apply **_data-driven strategies_** to refine their marketing efforts and achieve sustainable growth.

## Project Goals
- **Analyze Customer Needs and Competitor Landscape**: Understand market dynamics and the firm’s positioning.  
- **Develop Marketing Strategies**: Propose actionable guerrilla marketing and social media content strategies.  
- **Evaluate Impact**: Use key metrics to measure success and ensure alignment with the firm’s goals.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection**: Data was collected through **_interviews with the firm's management_** to understand their current challenges and opportunities. Additionally, a **competitor analysis** was conducted, focusing on Boston’s therapy market to identify strengths and weaknesses in comparison to industry peers. A **_social media audit_** of existing platforms was performed to assess the firm’s digital presence and engagement strategies.
- **Analysis**: The project applied **_Dolan’s Schematic of Marketing Process_** to evaluate critical elements such as customer needs, company skills, and competitive positioning. To enhance the firm's approach, the **_S.A.V.E. framework_** was utilized to emphasize solutions, access, value, and education over traditional marketing approaches.
- **Proposed Strategies**: Several innovative strategies were proposed, including creating **_guerrilla marketing campaigns_** like the **_“Talking Bench”_** to foster community engagement. Interactive social media content such as **_Q&A sessions_** and **_educational posts_** were recommended to build authority and trust among the audience. Additionally, **_website optimization for search engines_** was suggested to improve online discoverability and attract more organic traffic.

## Recommendations
1. **Social Media Enhancements**: Consistent posting of educational content, client success stories, and therapist profiles and leveraging interactive tools like polls and quizzes.  
2. **Guerrilla Marketing Campaigns**: Implement creative community-focused initiatives like the “Troubled Family Ducks” figurines and the “Talking Bench.”  
3. **Website Optimization**: SEO improvements to rank higher on Google and attract more organic traffic.
